        <Summary xml:lang="en">Libart is a library for high-performance 2D graphics.</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">Libart is a library for high-performance 2D graphics. Libart supports a very powerful imaging model, basically the same as SVG and the Java 2D API. It includes all PostScript imaging operations, and adds antialiasing and alpha-transparency. Libart is also highly tuned for incremental rendering. It contains data structures and algorithms suited to rapid, precise computation of Region of Interest, as well as a two-phase rendering pipeline optimized for interactive display.
